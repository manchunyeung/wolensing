wolensing
=========

``wolensing`` is a software package to simulate lensed gravitational waves. It computes the amplification factor in full wave optics within the range of LIGO sensitivity and is compatible with arbitrary lens models.

Installation
------------

First install ``lensingGW``::


  git clone https://gitlab.com/gpagano/lensinggw.git
  cd lensinggw
  python setup.py install

``wolensing`` can be installed with github or pip::

  pip install wolensing


Examples Notebooks
-------------------

The `examples <>` show the computation of wave optics amplification factor and the plots of them.
